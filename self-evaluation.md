// Self Evaluation
// After this lesson I feel pretty confident with the array content.
// I don't need any additional learning for arrays, I am excited to practice in pairing.
// I do have one question about arrays. If you use a .pop or .unshift then call a certain index, will it take the element from the modified .pop or .unshift array or original array?
